            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For my ſelf, I freely offer my ſelf a labourer to help forward the building, willing to bear ſome burden to the work; my will is good, my ability is ſmall; but I know God will accept a willing minde, and expects no more in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance then he hath given ſtrength: If with an honeſt heart I bring but an handfull of Goats hair to the building of Gods Talernacle; or with the poor widow caſt in my mite into Gods Treaſury, it ſhall be accepted with God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which aſſurance I have brought ſome rough materials (not fit to face the Work, as thoſe Pieces wrought by men of art and skill, but may ſerve) to ſtrengthen the fabrick in ſome places where they beſt fit.</p>
            <p>My end is Gods glory; my endeavour to ſatisfie thee (if it be poſsible) to undeceive the ignorant, who are ſeduced, and to eſtabliſh the doubtfull; that every one to his power may help forward Gods work, and cure their own miſery.</p>
            <p>Thy miſery thou feeleſt, if thou have either eſtate or ſence. The Cauſes are laid down in the following Diſcourſe, and that truely, without envy or flattery; as alſo the Cure is preſcribed: which if thou read, and read all; thy little labour in reading ſhall ſufficiently ſatisfie my much more labour in writing, for it is done for thee.</p>

Now God requires it of all who expect any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with Gods people: My reſolution is like that of <hi>Eſther</hi> (in the like caſe) <hi>If I periſh, I periſh:</hi> I ſpeak but truth, and that for God, the King, <note place="margin">Eſt 4. 16.</note> his kingdoms, and poſterities, and for the perſecuted people and church of God, which I am ſure is no Treaſon, but Dutie. I do it with upright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God, and Loyaltie to the King; and if I periſh in Gods Work, I ſhall be freed from periſhing. I paſſe not for the judgement of mans Day, God is the righteous Judge of me, and of him who judgeth me; If thou accept my endeavour, and through Gods bleſsing it be any advantage to thee, lend us thy Prayers (who ſhall ever pray for thee) and give the glory to God.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159069:5"/> either when we worſhip a falſe God; or the true God, in a falſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and is a denying of God to be God: Sets up ſomething created, in the room of the Creatour; which is the greateſt diſhonour that can be to God, (being committed by any that have ever known God) and God is moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Iſa 42 8.</note> and jealous of his honour: he will not give his glory to any other; but will ſurely make that man, or that nation miſerable, that thus diſhonour him; He commanded his people Iſrael; If any man or woman did worſhip any <note place="margin">Deut. 17 3 5.</note> other God, he ſhould be ſtoned to death; if a whole city, it was to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And when the two Tribes and half beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> erected an Altar, <note place="margin">Deu 13 12, 15</note> (ſuppoſed by the other nine Tribes and half to be for Idolatry) they all with <note place="margin">Joſh. 22.</note> one conſent took arms, to go againſt them: but being aſſured (by enquiry) that no ſuch thing was intended, they deſiſted. But when all Iſrael fell to Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry (for it is a ſin to which nature is very prone) and began to chuſe new Gods: (that is, to mingle with the pure worſhip of God, the ſuperſtitious Ceremonies of the heathens) preſently war was in their gates, and God <note place="margin">Judg 5. 8 Judg. 2. 14</note> gave them into the hands of ſpoilers that ſpoiled them; and into the hands of their enemies. See the ſame ſin in <hi>Solomon;</hi> and the puniſhment of it in his <note place="margin">1 Kings 11 11. 1 Kings 12 25. 16. 2 Chron.: 4 23 24. <hi>Ant.</hi> l. 9 c 2. 2 King 21 18.</note> ſon <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> Alſo in King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> for this ſin, God gave him into the hands of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> by a ſinall and weak army.

The examples of Gods high diſpleasure againſt this ſin are many, both in Sacred and humane writings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The prophaning of the Lords day.

               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed: and the people carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> till the land, for the ſpace of threeſcore and ten yeers, lay waſte, to keep her Subbaths (for ſo long they were in captivity) of which ſin and puniſhment, good <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> puts the people in minde, after their return, when they began again to prophane the Sabbath day; ſaying, Did not our fathers thus? And, Did not our <note place="margin">Neh. 13 18.</note> God therefore bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Pride. This was one of the ſins of wicked <hi>Sodome,</hi> that cryed to heaven for judgement; It is a ſin very hatefull to God and not pleaſing to men. <note place="margin">The third is pride</note> In other ſins men agree together in the ſin, but one proud man hates another that is as proud as he: This ſin ingageth God in war againſt men: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the proud: The Lord threatneth that he will deſtroy the houſe of the <note place="margin">Jan. 6. 4.

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Oppreſſion. This is one of the crying ſins that haſteneth Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt a nation, or private men: <hi>Ye ſhall not appreſſe one another, but thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The fourth ſin is Oppreſſion. Levit 25. 27.</note> 
               <hi>ſhalt fear thy God.</hi> This fear of God and Oppreſſion, are contraries: Where the fear of God is, there is no oppreſſion; and where dppreſſion is, there is no fear of God: Theſe cannot dwell together in one heart, nor in one kingdom; This is a ſin contrary to the nature of God, who is Mercy it ſelf: Therefore he heareth the cry of Labourers, ſervants, and ſtrangers, when their hire is kept back, and it entreth into the ears of the Lord: If the cry of the leſſe be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, <note place="margin">Deur 24 15.

Therefore came great wrath, from the Lord of hoſts, and afterward when miſery was an them, they cried, but God would not bear, becauſe they would not hear, when the Prophet of God cried to them in his Name; but they were ſcattered with a whirlwinde among all nations.</hi> The Scripture ſets forth oppreſſours, by the names and nature of cruell beaſts, Bulls, Bears, Wolves, Dogs, Kine of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan, &amp;c.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> tells them, <hi>That the Lordhath ſworn by his</hi>

            <p>Fifthly, Murther. This is another crying ſin: And this is committed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The fifth ſin Murder.</note> by ſhedding innocent blood, or by withholding judgement from the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of blood. The blood that is ſhed cryeth loud againſt both theſe, and aſcends into the ears of God. It is a ſin againſt nature, forbidden long before the Law was given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and it was puniſhed in the firſt age of the world: The <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 5. 6.</note> voice of <hi>Abels</hi> blood cryed upto God from the earth; It is expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Gen 4 11.</note> That the blood ſhedder ſhal be delivered to the hands of the avenger of blood; the reaſon is given in Verſe 10. That the guilt of innocnet blood lie not upon <note place="margin">Deut. 19. 12.</note> the Land. If blood lie upon a nation, it leaves a ſtain that cannot be put out, except Judgement be executed.

            <p>Sixthly, Drunkenneſſe. This ſin is of a double provocation. Firſt, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes <note place="margin">The ſixth ſin is Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Iſa. 5. 22. 1 Cor. 6. 10.</note> God to wrath, as it is a tranſgreſſion of his law, and is by the Apoſtle, excluded from the kingdom of heaven. Secondly, it provokes men to the breach of every Commandment of God, either to the act or guilt of all groſſe ſins; as Murther, Whoredom, Stealing, Lying, and Swearing, (a ſin under which the Land mourneth) it takes a way the heart from God, and inclines it to all wickedneſſe: Wo is the portion of them that follow after ſtrong drink; <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4. 11. Prov. 23. 29. Iſa. 5. 11. Verſe 22. Joel 15. Deu 29. 19. 20</note> and to them that are ſtrong to drink ſtrong drink. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> awakes the drouſie Drunkards, and bids them weep and howl: But the Drunkard is of all men moſt fearleſle, till the Judgement be upon his head.

            <p>Seventhly, Whoredom. This is a very grievous and an unnaturall ſin; for <note place="margin">The ſeventh ſin is Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 1 Cor. 6. 18. Heb. 13. 4.</note> by it a man ſinneth againſt his own body: In all other ſins of the ſecond Table, a man ſins againſt another; but by this a man ſins againſt himſelf, and others too.

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:159069:6"/> The whoremonger deſtroyeth two bodies, and two ſouls at once: Whoredom <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 32.</note> is of two ſorts; Adultery, and Fornication: Both are hatefull to God, and God hath excluded both from him in heaven, and excludeth himſelf from them, upon the earth, by ſeparating his ſervants from them, as the Prophet witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; <hi>O</hi> (faith he) <hi>that I had a lodging place in the wilderneſſe, that I might leave</hi>

We read, that the leaſt puniſhment that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> inflicted upon adulterers, was to cut off the noſe of the woman, and the privy parts of the man. <hi>Anthony,</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> cauſed his own ſon to die in priſon, becauſe he raviſhed a maid; and God by the Plague of Peſtilence, ſinote with death of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (for this ſin) three and twenty thouſand; and probably many thouſands more had died, if <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 28.

            <p>Eighthly, Lukewarmneſſe in Religion. This is alſo a ſin that God hates: <note place="margin">The eighth ſin is Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> When men are religious in profeſſion, and irreligious in practiſe: When they allow it in the form, but deny it in power: When they hate to be zealous, and ſhame to be prophane. This is a ſubtile deceiving ſin, it ſtops the mouth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by doing ſomething; and yet procures Gods wrath, becauſe they do not all: They flatter themſelves, as the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that they are rich and want nothing; when indeed, they are wretched, miſerable, poor, blinde, and naked, &amp;c. This was the deſtroying ſin of that Church, <hi>Thou art neither</hi>

            <p>Lukewarmneſſe, is diſpleaſing to God in divers reſpects: A Lukewarm man <note place="margin">Lukewarm men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant men.</note> is an unconſtant man; and that God hates: A Lukewarm Profeſſor, will change his Religion with the times and State; be of what Religion the King and State is, (be it what it will) theſe are (as <hi>James</hi> ſaith) like the waves of the ſea, driven <note place="margin">Jam. 16, 8. Gal 4 18. Tim 2 14.

            <p>Again, Lukewarm men are further from heaven then ſuch as are openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; <note place="margin">Lukewarm men are in worſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then men openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</note> the prophane groſſe ſinner is more liable to pricks and checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when the other reſts with confidence upon the outſide forms of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and thinks he hath done well, and all, if he abſtain from groſſe ſins of commiſſion; but regards not the ſins of omiſſion: Theſe men cry as the <hi>Jews,

            <p>But every ſin is aggravated, and provokes more either by the perſons that ſin, <note place="margin">Perſons and circumſtances aggravate ſin.</note> or the circumſtances in ſinning.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is aggravated by the perſons: The ſins of the godly, that profeſſe themſelves to be Gods ſervants and wear his livery &amp;c. do provoke God more then the ſins of the multitude of wicked men: Firſt, becauſe ſuch men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into ſpeciall Covenant with God; and bound to deny ungodlineſſe and <note place="margin">Acts 3. 25.</note> worldly luſts, to live ſober, righteous, and godly lives: for to this end hath <hi>the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, appeared unto all men;</hi> unto you firſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſſe you, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 11, 12.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſins of the godly do moſt diſhonour God; cauſe the Name of God to be blaſphemed, and the <hi>way of godlineſſe to be evill ſpoken of: The Name</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The godly are of Gods own family; he hath continuall eye upon them, and therefore chaſtiſeth them firſt of all other; you have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities; he <note place="margin">Amos. 4 2.</note> doth chaſtiſe them here; but uſually deferreth the judgements of the wicked, reſerving them to the great day of wrath: Yet alwayts when by the ſins of <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 18.

            <p>And ſo the time when ſin is committed is an aggravation of wrath: As to be drunk on the Lords Day, a Faſt day, &amp;c. is more ſinfull then upon another day; and to ſin at ſuch a time, when Gods Judgements are upon us; while God is whipping us for ſin, then to ſin, makes the ſame out of meaſure ſinfull, and <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2 16.

Theſ. 2. 7. &amp;c.</note> loſe their lives in the offenſive War againſt it: It is a ſtrange miſtery, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſhould Jeopard their lives to defend that they moſt hate: but ſuch is the miſtery of iniquity that now worketh: with the deceivableneſſe of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in our Lukewarm (though Learned) Centry: God hath for this ſin gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them up to a reprobate mind, filled with all unrighteouſneſſe, fornication, <note place="margin">Verſe 10.</note> wickedneſſe, coveteouſneſſe, maliciouſneſſe, envy, murdering, debate, deceit malignity, haters of God, &amp;c. to their own ruine, and their laſting infamy, to <note place="margin">Rom 1. 29. 30.</note> Poſteritie to come: conſider it, Oh ye Inhabitants of great Brittane, for Gods hand is heavy at this day for this ſin, repent therefore and be zealous, or God will ſpue us out of his mouth, and ſeperate us from the Congregations of his

            <p>The third thing to be conſidered is, the inſtrumentall cauſe of great Brittains <note place="margin">Satan is the efficient cauſe of ſin, and the Inſtrumentall cauſe in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> miſery, and that is either inward or outward.</p>
            <p>The inward Inſtrumentall cauſe is the Devill, working upon mens corrupt nature, and drawing them to ſin: The Devill is the efficient cauſe of ſin, but the inſtrumentall cauſe of puniſhment: He caſts into mens hearts the ſeeds of all ſins, and ſin (as is before ſhewed) brings all miſery: Why hath Satan filled thy heart (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Annanias)</hi> Satan fills the heart with ſin, either by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting <note place="margin">Acts. 5. 3.</note> thoughts into the heart, or bringing objects to the eye or eare: By thoughts hee brought <hi>David</hi> to number the people, and ſo brought miſery: <note place="margin">1. Chr: 21. 1.</note> hence it is that the Apoſtle bids, that we give not place to the Devill, that is, to <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 27.</note> evill thoughts: By objects to the eye, he brought <hi>David</hi> to commit adultery, and ſo brought miſery: By objects to the eare he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> by the voice of <note place="margin">2. Sam, 11. 2.</note> the Serpent, and by the report of the Spies drew the people to murmour in the <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 4.</note> Wilderneſſe, and ſo brought miſery: the Devill hath no power over the will of <note place="margin">Num: 13. 28.</note> any man to compell him to ſin, his power is onely by ſuch deluſions to blind the mind, and darken the underſtanding: and his power is great by theſe meanes upon them that believe not the Goſpell of Chriſt: hence it is that hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> the God of this World, and a Spirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience. <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Devill is the father of all Sedition: the originall of Envy and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: he is the tempter to all wickedneſſe: firſt he ſet man at variance with <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 20. lames 3. 15.</note> his maker, and ſo all the creatures one againſt another, &amp; for this cauſe God hath put an everlaſting enmity between him and the ſeed of the woman, and the ſame <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> enmity is between wicked men and the godly: By the ſeed of the woman is meant Chriſt and his children, therefore in Scripture thoſe that are of Chriſt are called the Children of God, and all wicked men they are called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">1. Joh: 1. 12. Iohn 3. 44.</note> of the Devill, and his works they do: Wicked men are the Devills ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to make War againſt the Children of God, againſt all the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who keepe the Commandements of God, and have the Teſtimony of <note place="margin">Rev: 12. 17.</note> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So then the outward cauſe is wicked men, the ſeed of that old ſerpent the <note place="margin">The outward cauſe of our miſery is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men.</note> Devill: Theſe are naturally ſtirred up to envy, and hatred againſt the godly: they hate purity and holineſſe, as that which is contrary to their very being, there is a direct Antipathy between their practiſe and holineſſe, as contrary as darkeneſſe is to light: They are therefore called the children of darkneſſe. and <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 8. 3.

            <p>The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi> were limited by the law of God: the <note place="margin">Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> and <hi>Judea.</hi>

            <p>Now other Kings, and Kingdomes, differ from both theſe governments: as moſt Kingdomes at this day differ one from another: Onely, in this, all Kingdomes have ever agreed: All have choſen and made their King. No King <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 14. All Kings ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the people.</note> ever made himſelfe a Kingdome, but the people made their King, therefore the Kingdome is greater then the King. It is true, that Kings by force have uſurped Kingdomes. And the Jewes after they became tributary to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had Kings ſet over them, and their Cuſtomes, Lawes, and Religion, changed; but that was by unlawfull force: but elſe all Kings were elected and choſen by the people, ſome for life onely, ſome for life and poſterity for ever. The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> choſe their Kings, and Emperours; but afterward the Souldiers ſet up in the Empire whom they would: as after, it fell out with thoſe great Monarchies. But the people of thoſe Monarchies had no <note place="margin">

            <p>The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> had a kind of power over the perſons and <note place="margin">Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> what power they had.</note> goods of the people, in neceſſary cauſes, but no further: although <hi>Samuel</hi> told the people (to deterre them from their deſire of a King) that their King would take their ſonnes, and appoint them for himſelfe, and for his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and to be his horſe-men, &amp;c. and that he would take the tenth of <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. v. 11. 15, 16.</note> their ſeed, and of their Vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his ſervants: But (ſaith he) you ſhall cry out in that day, becauſe of the King which yee have choſen: Now <hi>Samuel</hi> tels them this would be the manner of their King, <note place="margin">See verſ. 11.</note> not that it was the juſtice of the King to doe ſo; and therefore afterward when their King was eſtabliſhed, <hi>Samuel</hi> vindicateth his owne juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to all the people, before the King: that he had not taken an Oxe, or <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 3.</note> Aſſe, or any thing from any of them, nor defrauded, or oppreſſed any, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any bribes, &amp;c. yet in this the people were not to reſiſt their King.

Yet for all this we did not, nor might make any reſiſtance; all we did, was but to make our humble complaints, by petitions, and humble ſupplications to his Majeſty; and eſpecially our prayers to God for redreſſe, that we might be eaſed of our burdens under which we groaned, and ſome periſhed, taking it as a juſt ſcourge from the hand of God for our ſins, to ſuffer our Kings to be ruled by a Malignant counſell, to oppreſſe and afflict their loyall people: it was one of the judgenents that God threatned againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I will give <note place="margin">Job 34. 30.</note> children to be their Princes and babes ſhall rule over them, the people ſhall be <note place="margin">Eſa. 3. 4, 5. verſ. 12.</note> oppreſſed every one by another, and women ſhould have rule over them: and againe, I gave thee a King in mine anger, and tooke him away in my wrath: an oppreſſing, or ungodly King, is the wrath of God upon a Nation: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 11.</note> there ſhould be (ſaith reverend <hi>Calvine)</hi> no more ſaid of a King, then of a common robber, that violently taketh away thy goods, and an adulterer, <note place="margin">

            <p>Then I ſay, if Parliaments are protectors of the peoples liberties, much more ought they to protect their Religion, and to defend it with the hazard of their deareſt blouds againſt all oppoſers.

            <p>Beſides, if a King, or any his miniſters ſhall (under an eſtabliſhed Law, contrary to that Law) aſſault a private man to take away his life or goods without the ſentence of the Law: ſuch a private man is not bound to ſubmit his life, but rather to preſerve it, either by flight, or defend it by reſiſtance; a man is bound to defend the life of another, if unlawfully aſſaulted, much more his owne: every animall is by nature taught to defend it ſelfe, what <note place="margin">A private man may deſend himſelf againſt unjuſt violence</note> nature allowes to other creatures, it denies not to a man; beſides, the Law of the kingdom allowes a man to defend himſelfe againſt all unjuſt violence: And Scripture yeeldeth us warrantable example in that kingly Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> he defended himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul</hi> his King, although he would not lay his hand upon <hi>Saul</hi> teacherouſly to kill him, yet he would take up armes to defend himſelf: and himſelfe ſaith, that three wayes he might ſee the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and be guiltleſſe; either that he die a naturall death, or that God ſmite <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 10.</note> him by ſome extraordinary ſtroke, or that he wilfully deſcend into the battle and periſh.</p>

               <hi>David,</hi> then to tell them <hi>David</hi> had not fields and Vine-yards to give to every one of them. But this Popiſh faction declared plainely that they ſought the ruine of the Parliament, elſe why did they accuſe five mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at once of Treaſon, and perſwade the King to demand them out <note place="margin">Charging the five members, a breach of all priviledges of Parliament.</note> of the Houſe; if thoſe had beene delivered, by the ſame right, they might next day have accuſed as many more, and ſo as many as they pleaſed, (which we know they intended) where then had beene the priviledge of Parliament? (a precedent to Kings is no leſſe then a Law) is this but a jealouſie? Then they (by what meanes I know not) perſwaded the King to come in perſon to the Houſe, with 400. Cavaliers, deſperate men, armed with weapons of warre, to take them by force, or to deſtroy them, had not God ſent them away (as he did <hi>Eliah,</hi> when <hi>Ahab</hi> ſought his life.) I am ſure this was no jealouſie, when the Tower of <hi>London</hi> was committed to Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> afterward to <hi>Lunsford,</hi> and others, it was jealouſie enough; and when Captaine <hi>Legg,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> were authorized to keepe <hi>Hull,</hi> (both knowne Papiſts) afterward when the King withdrew himſelfe by their counſels, to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and the Queen ſent beyond Sea with the kingdomes jewels, to trafficke for men, money, and armes, I am ſure this proves more then jealouſie.</p>
            <p>When they drew the King (by their counſels) to <hi>Yorke,</hi> when there was no cauſe of feare, they deluded the people under the Kings name, and procured a ſtrong guard for his perſon, ſo they wrought meanes to make the King afraid of his people, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple afraid of their King: <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, he that thinketh a King can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the place where all are afraid of him, abuſeth himſelfe: Kings <note place="margin">See <hi>Senec. in Cle'n. l.</hi> 1. c. 19.</note> (ſaith he) need not ſortifie unacceſſable places, nor cut downe ſides of Mountaines, nor enſconce themſelves with wals, and towers; clemency will ſecure a King in the open fields, and that onely is his impregnable

Thus when they had procured their guard, pretended for defence, it proved preſently an army of offence to deſtroy the kingdome: And yet they would perſwade us there was nothing but needleſſe jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; any rationall man will ſay it was now time that the Parliament ſhould provide for the kingdomes ſafety, (for they prepared no army till things were gone thus farre againſt them) Then the Kings Standard was ſet up at <hi>Notingham,</hi> warre profeſſed, which before was by words, proteſtations, and atteſtations, under many of their falſe hands denyed.

But of all thoſe Acts of grace, that Act, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Parliament, was the chiefe: for the further redreſſe in things and cauſes of the kingdomes grievances, which elſe we could not but thinke would quickly have returned to the former evils, as we know <note place="margin">Petition of Right never obſerved.</note> things did formerly, notwithſtanding the Petition of Right granted by the King, and accepted by the people with great joy and thankfulneſſe: Yet his Majeſty through that wicked counſell, hath not obſerved it. What aſſurance or hope can we have of the continuance of any of the reſt, to enjoy them any longer then this, ſeeing this is all the ſecurity we have for them? And this which was one of the laſt enacted, is the firſt aſſaulted; for, if the King may, or can breake this, he may, or will deny us all the reſt: if ſuch a wicked malignant counſell be ſtill ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Therefore we have good cauſe to beleeve that that counſell conſented <note place="margin">The paſſing of the Bils of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefit in this Parliament but a trap to catch the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to make themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and all Lawes together.</note> to the paſſing of ſuch Statutes, onely to inſinuate into the peoples affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to blind their eyes with a ſhew of reformation, becauſe they well knew that the heavy burdens, and intolerable oppreſſions, that lay ſo newly upon the backe of the Subjects, had imbittered their hearts, and enraged the ſpirits of the people; which the paſſing of thoſe Acts, they thought, would mitigate, that by ſuch meanes they might ſeduce the people, and draw them (as they have done) to joyne with them againſt the Parliament, that ſo they might make them inſtruments to undoe themſelves, and to deſtroy all other Acts, and the whole Lawes: for by this way they have taken, they may (and meane to) deſtroy all as well

And the third night after, the <hi>Argians</hi> (when the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were ſecure) fell upon them, and ſaid the truce was but for the dayes, the nights were not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned We know divers ſuch equivocations, and Jeſuiticall cavils were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Spaine by Briſtoll,</hi> and ſo brought to the Court to counterfeit truth, as the <hi>Briſtoll</hi> ſtone doth the Diamond.</p>

            <p>We ſee our miſery, and the cauſes of it; the cure followes: but before we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the cure, take notice of an errour in men, ſeeking cure from things that <note place="margin">Error in the cure of miſery.</note> cannot help, and that increaſeth our miſery; we have in all our afflictions loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked too much to the hand of men, as the cauſes, and ſo for cure; and we have truſted to the arme of fieſh, to the creature, and to outward meanes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not that they are vaine: all things under the Sun, ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and vanity of vanities: not able to keepe themſelves from miſery, much leſſe can they helpe us, or cure our miſery.</p>
            <p>When God hath (as formerly) afflicted us with peſtelince, we have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to outward cauſes, corruptayre, ill diet, &amp;c. and ſought cure by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or fly from infected places to eſcape it. When God ſent great droughts, or extraordinary raine, which hath ſmit the fruits of the earth, we have beene ready to aſcribe it to the conjunctions of Planets, and to naturall cauſes: and from thence have expected remedy. When we have had rumours of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enemy, by invaſion, we have truſted to our ſeas and ſhipping, and our great preparations by Land. When we were afflicted by oppreſſions, taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and crrruption in juſtice, we aſcribe the cauſe to the diſcontinuance of Parliaments, and ſeeke to Parliaments for cure; thus we have looked to the arme of fleſh in all.</p>

            <p>Now we are come to the cure it ſelfe, God is he that cureth all miſery, <note place="margin">Eſa 41. 22.

            </p>
            <p>Now it is neceſſary that we inquire into two things: firſt, why God will cure his people: ſecondly, how God will cure his people, when they cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:159069:24"/>
            <p>To the firſt I anſwer, no other reaſon can be given why God will cure his people when they are in miſery, but for his owne name ſake: it is certaine there is nothing in man that can merit the leaſt good from God, for when the beſt of Gods owne people have done all the beſt they can, they fall ſhort of duty, and therefore are <hi>but unprofitable ſervants:</hi> now he <note place="margin">Iuke 17. 10.</note> that is unprofitable, and comes ſhort of that which is duty, cannot merit any thing: God at the firſt choſe himſelfe a people, of his free love, out of the corrupt lump of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, and out of the idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be a peculiar people to himſelfe. There can be no reaſon given why he did it, but becauſe it was his good pleaſure, <hi>he had a delight to love them:</hi> there was nothing lovely in them, <hi>When I paſſed by thee, I ſaw</hi>

Behold it was the time of love.</hi> He ſaith further: becauſe I loved <note place="margin">Dcut. 4. 37.</note> thy fathers, <hi>therefore I choſe their ſeede after them:</hi> the Lord hath avouched them <hi>to be his peculiar people,</hi> that they ſhould keepe his Commandements, not becauſe they did keepe his Commandements; he did not chuſe them becauſe they were holy, but becauſe they ſhould be holy: nor doth God ſave, or deliver them for their righteouſneſſe, but for his owne name ſake: <hi>The Lord will not forſake his people for his great name ſake:</hi> (as <hi>Samuel</hi> tels <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 22.</note> the people) becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>it hath pleaſed God to make you his people.</hi> There is a covenant betweene God and his people which he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> his ſervant, <hi>and it is an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> in which he hath bound himſelfe, to be the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, and <hi>that they ſhall be</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Quere is, how God doth cure his people, when they cry unto him.

            <p>Conſider therefore, that true, found, and acceptable repentance, is a turning to God, from all ſinne in action and will, totally, and for ever; with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Eſay 31. 6.

            <p>There is a deſtructive Peace as well as a deſtroying Warre, therefore a juſt Warre is to be choſen, rather than an unjuſt Peace, and is warrantably juſt

            <p>Our ſinfull peace hath beene the cauſe of this our puniſhing miſerable war: <note place="margin">Sinfull peace hath cauſed a puniſhing war.</note> and I ſee no ſcruple of doubt, but that we may with confidence, beleeve, that this ſo juſt a defenſive warre (by the bleſſing of God, for whoſe glory it is) will in Gods time eſtabliſh a true, bleſſed and happie peace.</p>

            <p>I have beene much larger in this diſcourſe then I intended, when I firſt ſet Pen to paper, and now want time, and phraſe to abreviate it: therefore I ſend it (as it is) among friends and foes, intreating the Reader to excuſe all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours or miſtakes by haſte, and accept the uprightneſſe of my intentions.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with a ſtory I remember, mentioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Marcus Otho,</hi> who was by the ſouldiers Elected Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and oppoſed by <hi>Vitilius Cecenna,</hi> where upon a Civill war began, and one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fought for the Empire, the Souldiers preſſed <hi>Otho</hi> to go on, and continue the warre, aſſuring him of victory, offering him the laſt drop of their blood in the cauſe, <hi>Marcus Otho</hi> replyed, I account this day more happy to me then the day I was pronounced Emperour, ſeeing your reall affection unto me; and I muſt dow ſhew it in not ſparing my life for the good of my Country; this warre (ſaith he) is not a warre againſt <hi>Haniball,</hi> nor <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves; and whether I conquer or am conquered, I ſhall offend my Country, I would rather ſacrifice my life for the peace and unity thereof: which ſaid; he fell upon his owne ſword: this was his love to his Country. But God be praiſed there is no ſuch cauſe of a warre in <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> nor cauſe why there ſhould be ſuch an end of it: we deſire but our rights and are ready to defend and maintaine the Right, Crowne, Life, and Honour, of the King, to the laſt drop of blood, yet we cannot have peace; but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie is pleaſed to heare wicked Councellors, and give them leave to War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us his faithfull Subjects, to deſtroy us, though with the hazard of his owne life and Kingdomes, which needleſſely he hath and doth expoſe to danger. The whole paſſages of the late Treaty ſhew the Parliaments deſire of Peace, ſo it might be with ſecuritie: there is nothing the King deſires but they Grant, except the delivering the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now to cloſe up all, let me give you ſome Reaſons, of my confidence (if you thus doe) that God will proſper you, and give deliverance in his due time to his Church, and to his people in this Kingdome, and for that take briefely theſe grounds following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it was the eſpeciall hand of God, and his Providence that brought this <note place="margin">7. Reaſons or grounds of confidence that God will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Church and people in this Kingdome at this time, if we uſe the meanes before preſcribed. Iohn. 11. 10. 51.</note> Parliament to ſit, (the King was the Inſtrument) and after to eſtabliſh it for ſome continuance of time, contrary to the expectation of all men, and oppoſite to the long continued purpoſes and deſignes of Malignant councellors: whom God as ſtrangely infatuated at that time, as at another time in another caſe, he as <hi>ſtrangely inſpired Caiphas</hi> to Propheſie <hi>that Chriſt ſhould dye for the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods wrath was never kindled againſt any people, or Kingdome, but for ſinne, eſpecially for the ſinnes of Idolatry, Sabboth-breaking, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like injuſtice: nor hath his wrath continued to deſolation, but for non-reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But God hath called this Parliament to purge ſinne, to overthrow Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:159069:34"/> to ſuppreſſe Sabboth-breakers, and to reforme publicke injuſtice, arming them with Soveraigne Authority by his owne power, and by the Authority of the King: to which worke they have wholly devoted themſelves; and for that very cauſe, they are at this time ſo ſtrongly oppoſed by the powers of hell and earth. Therefore God will maintaine his owne cauſe, and his ſervants wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his worke, and in his owne time will make their worke proſperous in their hands, as he did to <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hath afflicted <hi>Britaine</hi> for theſe ſinnes, and a multitude of other tranſgreſſions, and doth ſtill continue to afflict us for our impenitencie: but it is obſervable that he whips us becauſe he would convert us; and yet he preſerves us from deſtruction, becauſe he would not totally deſtroy us: therefore hath wonderfully diſcovered the Plots of the enemie, and blaſted their bloody de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, when they had prepared them (as they thought) ready to deſtroy us; <hi>former mercies are engagements of future deliverance;</hi> hence I conclude from the confidence of <hi>Manoahs</hi> wife (when an Angell had told her <hi>ſhe ſhould beare a</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I finde by all Stories Divine, and Humane, (that ever I read) that before God deſtroyed a people or Kingdome, he hath taken away his <hi>Prophets, Iudges, and righteous men,</hi> or they have beene rarely found, or elſe he hath taken <note place="margin">Eſay 57. 1. Exod. 32. 10. Ier. 7. 16. Ier. 14, 11.</note> off their <hi>affections, and ſpirits from prayer,</hi> for that people or Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe this hath in part beene made good to <hi>England,</hi> ſome have beene over awed, their mouthes ſtopped, ſome baniſhed, others deſtroyed, and many forced to flie to other Countries for ſhelter: Yea, the two Fountaines of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and holineſſe (as well as the Courts of juſtice) were exceedingly corrupted: all which preſaged a ſtorme comming, and now it is come: But conſider Gods <note place="margin">Iſay 1. 26.</note> Miniſters are reſtored, increaſed, and many returned from their Exile, <hi>righteous Iudges are ſet up, and good men put in Authority.</hi> The affections of the godly (and that of many thouſands) are moved with zeale to God exceedingly, and their hearts ſtirred up to earneſt conſtant prayer, and unwearied labours: have ſeene ſome gracious returnes of their prayers, and fruit of their labours, <hi>and waite</hi>

               <hi>by faith with patience, till the Lord plead their cauſe, and execute Iudgement for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, notwithſtanding the corruption of the fountain, God hath from thence produced pure ſtreames, planted fruitefull vines in his Orchard. When were more young, able, godly, Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> then now? When were men ſtirred up with zeale for God <hi>to lift up their voyces like Trumpets, to tell Iſrael</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, no ſtory of any age or people, can give a preſident, that ever God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed an humbled praying people, (notwithſtanding the irreligiouſneſſe of a multitude of godleſſe men, amongſt which they live, whom God can cut off <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 30.</note> ſome other way, <hi>or reſerve to greater wrath)</hi> but if a conſiderable number of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:159069:34"/> repenting reformers have beene found, God hath for their ſakes ſpared ſuch a people or Nation; therefore this Church and Nation: Onely we muſt conſider <note place="margin">Tim 2. 19.</note> God lookes for a greater number in <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> than in any other Nation or Kingdome; God would have ſpared <hi>Sodom for ten righteous ſake,</hi> yet <hi>ſeven</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 48. Gen. 18. 32. 1 King. 19. 18.</note> 
               <hi>thouſand in Iſrael was too few,</hi> (although God tooke notice of them all) and ſurely twice ſeven thouſand cannot ſave <hi>England:</hi> but if thoſe in <hi>England who have given their Names to Chriſt,</hi> be found to be truely <hi>repenting, praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their evill wayes,</hi> with reſolution to perſeveere; undoubtedly <hi>England</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 7. 14. Iohn. 17. 19.</note> ſhall be ſaved for their ſakes. The example of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the time of <hi>Joſiah;</hi> nor the preſent condition of <hi>Germany</hi> are no objections of validity againſt this truth, except we reſolve to cheriſh our baſe luſts, ſeeke our private ends, love our ſelves; ſo as to neglect God and the meanes he hath in mercy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1 Chron. 28. 9. ult.</note> given us to ſave us: <hi>this is to forſake God, and then God will forſake us, and caſt us off for ever;</hi> and it ſhall be ſaid of <hi>England,</hi> as once of <hi>Babel; we would have</hi>

               <hi>healed Babel, and ſhe would not be healed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6ly, Although for theſe ſins, now raigning in this Kingdome, namely Idolatry, prophanation of the Sabboth, oppreſſion, &amp;c. God hath deſtroyed whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, <hi>layd them maſt,</hi> and given up his owne people with the wicked into his <note place="margin">Ier. 24. 5.</note> enemies hands. Yet you muſt conſider it was when generally or wholly, the people were willing to yeeld to ſuch ſinnes as it was before and inſtantly after <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> time.

            <p>Seventhly, it hath beene uſuall with God when admonitions have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and eaſier chaſtiſements ſlighted, to lay great and heavie Iudgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 29.</note> his owne people, <hi>and of long continuance;</hi> and in theſe Iudgements to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many of his children, <hi>till his people returne and earneſtly ſeeke God,</hi> and till <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 15.

               <hi>deſtruction to their enemies</hi> will be ſeene to all the world: and aſſuredly deliverance will come to <hi>Britaine,</hi> if we waite by faith and patience, with diligent uſe of the meanes, without murmuring at the miſcarriages, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in things, failing of men or Armies, confided in: or be diſcouraged at the ſeeming unproſperous ſucceſſe of our Armies, or the ſucceſſefull enterpriſes <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 18.

            <p>But there are foure evills that exceedingly hinder the worke of <hi>Britaines</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, which muſt be removed.
